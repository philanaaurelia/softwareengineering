# About
This is a list of FREE resources I have found helpful to prepare for programming interviews as well as some great resources for learning data structures and algorithms. I purposely will keep this list small; I've noticed that other lists have given me decision paralysis - there were so many links. Hopefully this is not overwhelming for you

If a link happens to be more than 5 years old, but still relevant, you will see a cross (‚úù) at the end of the link.
